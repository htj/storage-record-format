\subsection*{Abstract}

To enable a shared storage infrastructure, it must be possible to account and
report the resources consumed by persons and groups in a common format. This
document describes such a format, which can describe the storage resources
consumed on a storage system. The format allows for granularity on storage
system level (e.g. seperating disk and tape consumption) as well as as
allowing reporting on both a per-user or a per-group base.
Due to a general approach the StAR format is not restricted to the usage in
a distributed (Grid) environment but can be applied in any storage environment.

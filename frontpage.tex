\subsection*{Abstract}

To enable a shared storage infrastructure, it must be possible to account and
report the resources consumed by persons and groups in a common format. This
document describes such a format, which can describe the storage resources
consumed on a storage system. The format allows for granularity on storage
system level (e.g., seperating disk and tape consumption) as well as as
allowing reporting on both per-user or per-group.

This document does not address how the record should be exchanged.
